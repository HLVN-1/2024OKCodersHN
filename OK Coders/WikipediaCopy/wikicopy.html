            Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee OM KBE FRS FREng FRSA DFBCS RDI (born 8 June 1955),[1] also known as TimBL, is
            an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, the HTML markup language,
            the URL system, and HTTP. He is a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford[2] and a
            professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[3][4]</p>
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Timothy John Berners-Lee was born in London on 8 June 1955,[24] the son of mathematicians and computer
            scientists Mary Lee Woods (1924–2017) and Conway Berners-Lee (1921–2019). His parents were both from
            Birmingham and worked on the Ferranti Mark 1, the first commercially-built computer. His paternal
            grandmother was a Canadian woman from Winnipeg.[25] He has three younger siblings; his brother, Mike, is a
            professor of ecology and climate change management. Berners-Lee attended Sheen Mount Primary School, then
            attended the Emanuel School (a direct grant grammar school at the time) from 1969 to 1973.[1][20] A keen
            trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.[26] From 1973 to
            1976, he studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA in physics.[1][24] While
            there, he made a computer out of an old television set he had purchased from a repair shop.[27</p>
